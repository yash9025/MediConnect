## 🔥 Features

### 🧠 A. AI Report Analyzer (Gemini Brain)
- Understands medical correlations beyond keywords
- Example:  
  `High Sugar + Thirst + Weight Loss → Diabetes risk`

✅ Works even if report is missing → falls back to symptom-based analysis.

---

### 🗂 B. Hybrid File Handling (Error-Resilient)
To prevent common errors like **fetch failure / missing file**, we implemented a universal file handler.

✅ Detects where the report exists:
- Local disk → `fs.readFileSync`
- Cloudinary URL → `fetch`

This makes the platform stable and production-friendly.
