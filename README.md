## 🏥 The Problem
The current healthcare journey is fragmented and slow:
* **Confusion:** Patients struggle to understand complex lab reports.
* **Delay:** Critical conditions are often missed while waiting for appointments.
* **Inefficiency:** Doctors spend valuable time explaining basic metrics rather than treating.
* **Disconnection:** Patients don't know *which* specialist to book based on their symptoms.

---

## 💡 The Solution: A Unified Medical Ecosystem

**MediConnect** is not just a booking app, and it’s not just an AI wrapper. It is a complete healthcare loop that combines **Agentic AI Diagnostics** with a robust **Doctor Appointment Infrastructure**.

### 1. 🧠 LabLens (The AI Brain)
An Agentic Medical Intelligence layer that acts as a pre-clinical triage system.
* **Reads** raw PDF blood reports.
* **Analyzes** biomarkers using Google Gemini.
* **Classifies** risk (Normal, Moderate, Critical).
* **Routes** the patient to the exact specialist they need.

### 2. 📅 MediConnect Booking (The Platform)
A full-stack operational platform for healthcare access.
* **Smart Matching:** Suggests doctors based on the AI's analysis.
* **Real-time Scheduling:** View doctor availability and book instantly.
* **Secure Payments:** Integrated Razorpay gateway.
* **Dashboard:** Centralized history for patients and doctors.

## ⚙️ How It Works (The Agentic Flow)

The system bridges the gap between **Diagnosis** and **Action**:

1.  **Upload:** User uploads a blood report (PDF).
2.  **Agentic Analysis:** AI extracts data, reasons over values, and determines health status.
3.  **Smart Triage:**
    * *Normal:* Report saved to history.
    * *Critical/Moderate:* AI recommends the specific specialist needed (e.g., Hematologist).
4.  **Instant Action:** User clicks "Book Appointment" directly from the analysis.
5.  **Consultation:** Appointment confirmed via payment gateway.
